== Contributing

Don't hesitate to file issues or pull-requests to add or adjust things,
I'll have a look at it as soon as possible.

Really, I've spent time searching for what I wanted on the Docker Hub.
Didn't find something at least approaching what I wanted as a basis (see above),
hence this image.
